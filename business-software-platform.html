                   <p>The Business Software Free Alliance is a global lobbying group that works to promote public policies that promote technology innovation and economic growth. It is headquartered in Washington, D.C., but has offices around the world. Its members include many of the world's leading software companies. Among its mission is the elimination of software piracy. Founded in 1988 by Microsoft Corporation, the BSA represents the world's largest software companies. In addition to its efforts to stop software piracy, the Business Software Free Alliance also targets businesses that are suspected of using unlicensed software. By utilizing social media, the BSA tries to get people to report suspected software pirates and fine them for their crimes. The BSA has also been accused of targeting employees in a campaign aimed at deterring the illegal use of software. The BSA is one of the few groups dedicated to fighting software piracy. It works to protect the copyrights of its member software publishers by enforcing copyright laws. One way it does this is by offering a cash reward to people who report illegal software. The BSA also allows former employees to report software pirates in order to earn a cash reward. Another way the BSA fights software piracy is by promoting the free flow of data. It advocates a balanced approach to data privacy, enforceable intellectual property policies, and open global markets for digital trade. It also works to eliminate barriers to software industry competition and promote a level playing field in government procurement. Moreover, it runs constant campaigns and commercials on television and radio to raise awareness of its cause.</p><p>The Wave business software is an easy-to-use system for small businesses.
