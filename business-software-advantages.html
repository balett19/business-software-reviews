The mobile app allows users to create and send invoices, take pictures of receipts, track expenses, and view financial performance. It also helps businesses keep track of inventory. Users can easily add and adjust reorder quantities as well as manually adjust stock quantities. In addition, they can import items in bulk and set multiple sales prices.
